Ubudu SDK Version 1.10 Release Notes
-------------------------------------

Platform Support
----------------
* General:
	- iOS 6.x or higher
	- iPhone 4 or more recent
* Beacon features:
	- iOS 7.0 or higher (iOS 7.1.2 or iOS 8.x recommended)
	- iPhone 4S / iPad 3rd gen. / iPod 5th gen. or more recent


Features Added in Version 1.10
------------------------------

 * Added an authorization management module (helps managing the status of iOS services needed to optimally detect beacons).
 * Added beacon region enter & exit events to the SDK API.
 * Retry a few times server notifications that fail before considering them as a real failure.


Issues Addressed in Version 1.10
--------------------------------
 
 * The isRunning property of UbuduSDK is now KVO compliant.
 * Improved background support for network requests of the SDK to the Ubudu API.


Known Issues
------------

 * Latch time feature for beacons rules with "on_exit" trigger does not work.
 * Latch time feature for geofences rules do not check if the device exited the geofence before executing the actions.
 * When a rule contains a local notification action + at least 2 other actions (except server notification) then only the first action is executed when the user clicks on the local notification (problem arises only when the app is in background).


Compatibility
-------------

Public API has been greatly modified in version 1.1, therefore applications written for version 1.0 must be adapted to compile with Ubudu SDK v1.1 and above.

Some URLs of the back-office API have changed in version 1.3.1. It is strongly advised so use this version to access the last version of the back-office API.

Changes have been done on the public API in version 1.4 to follow more thoroughly Objective-C coding style and naming recommandations. You may have to proceed to a few adaptations in your code if you were using a previous version.

Support for iOS 8 has been introduced in version 1.7. The SDK still compiles fine against the previously supported iOS SDK versions.
