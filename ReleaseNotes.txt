Improvements

None

Issues Addressed
----------------

- Hot fix where new delegate method (shouldExecuteLocalNotificationRequest:triggeredBy:completionBlock:) was not called

Known Issues
------------

 * Latch time feature for geofences rules do not check if the device exited the geofence before executing the actions.
 * When a rule contains a local notification action + at least 2 other actions (except server notification) then only the first action is executed when the user clicks on the local notification (problem arises only when the app is in background).


Compatibility
-------------

Public API has been greatly modified in version 1.1, therefore applications written for version 1.0 must be adapted to compile with Ubudu SDK v1.1 and above.

Some URLs of the back-office API have changed in version 1.3.1. It is strongly advised so use this version or above to access the last version of the back-office API.

Changes have been done on the public API in version 1.4 to follow more thoroughly Objective-C coding style and naming conventions. You may have to proceed to a few adaptations in your code if you were using a previous version.

Support for iOS 8 has been introduced in version 1.7. The SDK still compiles fine against the previously supported iOS SDK versions.

Methods related to 'localized ads' feature have been removed in version 1.14. If you were using any of them just remove the method calls and you'll be fine, as they were not doing anything anyway.
