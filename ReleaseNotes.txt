Compatibility
-------------

Public API has been greatly modified in version 1.1, therefore applications written for version 1.0 must be adapted to compile with Ubudu SDK v1.1 and above.

Some URLs of the back-office API have changed in version 1.3.1. It is strongly advised so use this version to access the last version of the back-office API.

Changes have been done on the public API in version 1.4 to follow more thoroughly Objective-C coding style and naming recommandations. You may have to proceed to a few adaptations in your code if you were using a previous version.

Support for iOS 8 has been introduced in version 1.7. The SDK still compiles fine against the previously supported iOS SDK versions.
